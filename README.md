# Cocktail Clustering Project

## Overview
This project focuses on exploratory data analysis (EDA) and clustering of a cocktail dataset. The task involves conducting EDA, cleaning and preprocessing the data and performing clustering using **KMeans** and **DBSCAN** to identify unique clusters of cocktails based on their ingredients and characteristics.

## Data
The dataset contains cocktails with associated ingredient lists and characteristics. It's stored in a `.json` file located in the `data` folder. This is loaded and processed into a DataFrame format for easy manipulation and analysis using Pandas.

## Quick start
To replicate the experiments, follow these steps.

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/DominikaStefaniak/ml-solvro-recuitemnt.git
